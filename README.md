# dj-sona-bot
 Can resolve Youtube links, including playlists, using ytdl-core-discord and search queries with ytsr.
 DJ Sona also uses TTS to notify when a user connects or disconnects from a voice channel.
 
 COMMANDS:
 
 !play: adds a song/playlist to the queue or search result.
 
 !stop: clears the queue and disconnects the bot.
 
 !list: shows the first 5 songs in the queue.
 
 !pause: pauses the music.
 
 !resume: resumes the music.
 
 !skip: skips current song.
 
 !help: shows info and commands.
 
 !hello: say hello to the bot.
 
 !greeting: toggles tts on/off.
 
 
 DISCLAIMER: some channel IDs or roles may be hardcoded because I use this bot in my personal Discord server. This will be fixed in the future.
